# ServCraft's candidate developer assessment
The purpose of this repo is to get a sense of a candidate software developer's aptitude, potential and level of experience.
It is designed as a pair-programming exercise between the candidate and the interviewer. 

The things we're most interested in are:
 * What kind of application is this?
 * How did you go about learning the codebase?
 * How would you test this application?
 * What changes would you make, and why?
   * Anything goes.
   * This is a conversation, not a test, there are no right or wrong answers

We also want to know what the candidate's thoughts, assumptions and questions are.
